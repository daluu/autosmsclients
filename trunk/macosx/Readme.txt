Finally got a Mac to build and test this widget. Unfortunately, only partially
works due to some missing session state cookie support between the web content
and the XmlHttpRequest. And replacing with Flash component for XmlHttpRequest
didn't help. So that's too bad. Issue is with sending message, always get
code error (enter code correctly) due to session state issue.

Anyways, have fun playing with it and see if you can fix the problem.
