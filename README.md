AutoSMS clients
=========

***NOTE:*** this project is dead as the upstream dependency is down/gone, so the code here is just left for reference.

This project site hosts various clients (browser extensions, plugins, etc.) for the free AutoSMS web-based text messaging service.
Seeing as how some Google Chrome extensions have their source hosted on Google code, thought I should do similarly.
The source files here can serve as useful examples of how to port an application/gadget/widget 
across different browser/client platforms.

For more details on AutoSMS service, see the service website at http://www.watacrackaz.com/autosms.

That service also offers a Firefox extension and Facebook app, so I only built for the other remaining browsers who have been 
left out along with a few other platforms. The service also has an Android app at http://www.textr.us/anonytext.
