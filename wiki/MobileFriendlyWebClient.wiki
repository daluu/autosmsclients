#summary A web version of AutoSMS that is kind of mobile friendly, usable in any browser

=Mobile Friendly Web Client=

Not quite optimized for mobile like iPhone, but usable in any browser w/o installation. Same as using AutoSMS on the main site, only w/o all the other crap on the site, a more simplified layout for mobile, etc. 

*NOTE:* I could use help in touching up the UI to be mobile friendly/scalable/adaptable.

Use either of these URLs to access:

FYI, original main site that is not mobile friendly is: http://www.watacrackaz.com/autosms/
